  VP: UNION {[Nodes -> Powers]: Nodes \in SUBSET AllNodes \ {{}}},

    \* i.e., a multi-set. We store the validators instead of the hash.

    \* i.e., a multi-set. We store the next validators instead of the hash.

VARIABLES

    (* The global height of the oldest block that is younger than
       the trusted period (AKA the almost rotten block).

    blockchain,
    (* A sequence of BlockHeaders, which gives us a bird view of the blockchain. *)
    Faulty
    (* A set of faulty nodes, which can act as validators. We assume that the set
       of faulty processes is non-decreasing. If a process has recovered, it should
